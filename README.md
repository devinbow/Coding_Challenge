# Coding_Challenge

Challenge was completed in two hours.

Made in intelliJ in Java 17.

There are maven requirements for JUnit, but they should be included.

Not the most complicated solution, but it gets the job done. I realized after a bit that time complexity would go down if a search tree was used, but was already far enough along with this method. Would definitely go a more time-conscious route in the future. 

There is a simple test associated with the conversion function to pass the parameters, but nothing too rigerous. Code coverage is difficult without a roman numeral->decimal function. With more time, I would have implemented this.
