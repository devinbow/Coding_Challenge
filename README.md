# Coding_Challenge

Challenge was completed in two hours.

Made in intelliJ in Java 17.

There are maven requirements for JUnit, but they should be included.

There is a simple test associated with the conversion function to pass the parameters, but nothing too rigerous. Code coverage is difficult without a roman numeral->decimal function. With more time, I would have implemented this.
